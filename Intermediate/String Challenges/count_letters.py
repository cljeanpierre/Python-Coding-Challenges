#String Challenges (Intermediate)

'''
Challenge 
Count the number of unique letters in a string. In other words, any new letters should be counted and any 
duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we will use the provided alphabet 
string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Uppercase and lowercase letters should be counted as
different letters
