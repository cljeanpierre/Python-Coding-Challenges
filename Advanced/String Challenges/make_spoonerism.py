Challenge 
A Spoonerism is an error in speech when the first syllables of two words are switched. For example, a Spoonerism
is made when someone says “Belly Jeans” instead of “Jelly Beans”. We are going to make a function that is 
similar, but instead of using the first syllable, we are going to switch the first character of two words.
