#String Challenges (Advanced)

'''
Challenge 
Letâ€™s say we are writing a program that displays a large message on a blimp and we need to fill in any missing
space if a short phrase is provided. Our function will accept a string and if the size is less than 20, it will
fill in the remaining space with exclamation marks until the size reaches 20. If the provided string already 
has a length greater than 20, then we will simply return the original string.

#Add Exclamation

def add_exclamation(word):
  while (len(word) < 20):
    word += "!"
  return word

print(add_exclamation("Codecademy"))
# should print Codecademy!!!!!!!!!!
print(add_exclamation("Codecademy is the best place to learn"))
# should print Codecademy is the best place to learn
